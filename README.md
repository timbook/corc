# corc - A Terminal Productivity Manager [Very WIP]

`corc` (abbreviation of "cork board") is a curses-based terminal application. It is an extreme work in progress right now, but the final product aims to have two modes:

* **Todo List:** A terminal-based todo list.
* **Cork board-like productivity manager:** A very simplistic productivity manager reminiscent of Trello, but not so reminiscent as to get sued.

Both modes will have vim-like keybindings, because how else should it be?

## Current todos (ironically not stored in a `corc` list):
* Ability to add/rename todos.
* Configure program to store lists/boards in a .json-like structure somewhere on system.
* Add screen to select list/board before entering.
* Begin even thinking about the cork board implementation.
